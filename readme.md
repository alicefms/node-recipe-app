# Recipe App

This is a small, purposefully-incomplete recipe app intended to be used in some Copilot workshops. 

- Built with Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and Sqlite.
- Scafholds a database with seed data on first launch.
- Handles the creation, listing, and editing of recipes.

Some ideas of what to add:

- A `/recipes/random` endpoint to select a random recipe.
- A way to delete recipes within the web application.
- A way to search recipes.
- Support for multiple units of measurement on recipes.
